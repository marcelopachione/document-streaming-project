# Document Streaming
This repository contains the capstone projects related to Document Streaming.

## Overview:

- Containerize the Streamlit app using Docker (create and include in the Dockerfile).
- Deploy the entire platform, including all containers, on a cloud platform of your choice.
- Implement an API layer between Streamlit and MongoDB to prevent direct access to MongoDB (handling user credentials securely).
